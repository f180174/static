            <h4>About Bill Gates:</h4>

                        Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates III, (born October 28, 1955, Seattle, Washington, U.S.),
                        American computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded Microsoft Corporation, the world‚Äôs
                        largest personal-computer software company.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        Gates wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school he helped form a group
                        of programmers who computerized their school‚Äôs payroll system and founded Traf-O-Data, a company
                        that sold traffic-counting systems to local governments.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        Largely on the strength of Microsoft‚Äôs success, Gates amassed a huge paper fortune as the
                        company‚Äôs largest individual shareholder. He became a paper billionaire in 1986, and within a
                        decade his net worth had reached into the tens of billions of dollars‚Äîmaking him by some
                        estimates the world‚Äôs richest private individual.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        Gates at first preferred to stay out of the public eye, handling civic and philanthropic affairs
                        indirectly through one of his foundations.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        All of these qualities were evident in Gates‚Äôs nimble response to the sudden public interest in
                        the Internet. Beginning in 1995 and 1996, Gates feverishly refocused Microsoft on the
                        development of consumer and enterprise software solutions for the Internet, developed the
                        Windows CE operating system platform for networking noncomputer devices such as home
                        televisions.
